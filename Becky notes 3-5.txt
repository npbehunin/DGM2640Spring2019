Becky notes

Storyboarding: Talked more about composition in storyboards. Used Indiana Jones as an example. Start our storyboards for our 1 minute story.

Modeling: Reviewed a double jump mechanic for people who needed it. Briefly covered character controllers. (I don't have the script for it unfortunately)

Game design: Reviewed everything we're covering by the end of the semester. 

By Mar.13 we should develop player mechanics, and the mechanics interacting with the level. Also create a "Hazard slice" of our level that features a hazard our players can run into.

Mar 20 Lighting Demo. Work on character design and character model texturing.

Mar 27 Animation Rigging implementation

Apr 3 Environment focus

Apr 10 VFX demo

[Modeling should be done around Apr 17.]

[Art should be done around Apr 24.]

[Scripting should be done around May 1.]

Rigging: Reviewed IK rigging again for anyone who was confused.

IK System:
- Create joints
- Orient Joints (Values in Z (for elbow, or middle joint), Orientaton in X, Y. X is down.)
- IK handle
- Pole Vector (The direction the "elbow" is pointing)
- Controls

1. Create 3 joints, shoulder, elbow, wrist
2. Orient: (Shoulder > X, Z, X-) Make sure orient children of selected joints is checked
3. Create IK handle and select shoulder and wrist
4. Create 3 nurb controls in groups (shoulder, arm, and wrist)
5. Shoulder to shoulder joint, wrist to wrist joint
6. Arm to elbow. Zero it out.
7. Move away from the elbow and freeze any transformations.
8. Select the arm nurb and ik handle, and do a "pole vector" contrain. If done right nothing will move.
9. Constrain shoulder to shoulder joint
10.
