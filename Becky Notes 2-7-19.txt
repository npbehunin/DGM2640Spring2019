Setting up controls

Create > Nurbs primatives > circle (Circles are used most in the industry)

Objects can't be animated if it has a constraint, so we're putting the constraint on the parent group. (Constrain > Parent, Scale)

Renamed the circle nurb we created to lower_arm_control
Created a group, called it lower_arm_control_group and put the lower_arm_control in this group

Selected lower arm joint of our lamp and the new group...
Modify > Match Transformations > Match all (Attached to lower arm)

(This makes it so the parent group has the transformations, but the nurb's transformations will remain at 0.)

Duplicated this group and matched the transformations to the other joints.
Parented these new groups together and put it under one "control" group. 

"Assignment:" Try to get everything parented and working correctly.
