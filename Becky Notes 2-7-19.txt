Setting up controls

Create > Nurbs primatives > circle (used most in industry)

Objects can't be animated if it has a constraint, so we're putting the constraint on the parent group.

renamed the circle nurb we created to lower_arm_control
Created a group, called it lower_arm_control_group

Selected lower arm joint and the group...
Modify > Match Transformations > Match all (Attached to lower arm)

(This makes it so the parent group has the transformations, but the nurb's transformations will remain at 0.)
